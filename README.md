# cop-3701-Insurance-Claims-Risk-Analytics-Database
Project Scope: This project intends on acheiveing goals such as:
      -Creating a relational database schema.
      -Creating tables to show to each one of our users.
      -Writing SQL queries to track claim history, scan trends in payouts, and indentify any fraud-risk variables.
      -Analyse historical claims with the help of indexes for optimization.
      -Importing sample data into the database as a test.

Users: There are a variety of users in this porject including:
      -Database administrators for insurance claims.
      -Insurance analysts.
      -Fraud detection teams/groups.

Data sources: 
      -Dataset - Sample Insurance Claim Prediction Dataset
      -Hyperlink - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/easonlai/sample-insurance-claim-prediction-dataset
      -Description - This dataset compares whether a claim occured along with its charges against the demographic and other health-related variables.

Applications used:
      -dbdiagram.io - For the Entity-Relationship diagram that was commited along with this update, dbdiagram.io was used to create a clean diagram
                      that shows all of the different types of relationships as well as the primary and foreign key througout all of the tables. One
                      issue that has been occuring when using this application is that the symbol that shows optional relationships isn't available
                      on here so instead for every attribute in a relationship, a label called "Not Null" needed to be used to show mandatory relationships.
      -Oracle Database - I will be using this database for the creation of tables that include their data which dbdiagram.io doesn't provide. The only
                         issue that this database has is that some of its features are limited but this will be circumvented by upgrading to an express
                         version that will provide more freedom the the creation of all of these tables that this project requires.
